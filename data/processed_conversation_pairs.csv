really,yes
yes,yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the ags notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either
not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices,its possible
its possible,well what do you think we ought to do about it
well what do you think we ought to do about it,i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out
i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out,i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training,no i never did either
i suppose the idea was specialized training,i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation
i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation,oh
oh,yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout
yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout,no as a matter of fact i didnt
no as a matter of fact i didnt,oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard
i dont know all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told,that seems very unlikely
that seems very unlikely,yes i thought so
yes i thought so,of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
of course it would be very easy for us to find out now,how
how,just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal
just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal,thats true
not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training,yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us
yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us,i know it would be almost inconceivable
i know it would be almost inconceivable,but not completely inconceivable
but not completely inconceivable,i suppose it isnt logically impossible
i suppose it isnt logically impossible,i guess it isnt
i guess it isnt,still all we have to do is ask hal
well thats something,yes i dont know what to make of it
yes i dont know what to make of it,i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong,yes but its more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
yes but its more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low,anyway its just as well that we replace it better safe than sorry
good morning hows it going,are you reasonably awake
are you reasonably awake,oh im fine im wide awake whats up
oh im fine im wide awake whats up,well hals reported the aounit about to fail again
well hals reported the aounit about to fail again,youre kidding
youre kidding,no
i dont know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure,two units in four days how many spares do we have
two units in four days how many spares do we have,two more
two more,well i hope theres nothing wrong with the assembly on those other wise were out of business
hal,yes
its the last one,well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it
i didnt do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them,i guess you dont know your own strength old boy
i guess you dont know your own strength old boy,i guess not
i guess not,i think ill have to go out and burn them off
i think ill have to go out and burn them off,roger
im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know,hes got a point
sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem,what is it hal
what is it hal,my fpc shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit
the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours,i understand hal well take care of it please let me have the hard copy
not now hal id like to talk to you about something,sure dave whats up
sure dave whats up,you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition,yes i know
yes i know,you probably also know that we found them okay
you probably also know that we found them okay,yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail
im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong,hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem
hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem,look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear
look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear,okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on
naturally dave im not pleased that the aounit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history,im sorry about the misunderstanding hal
im sorry about the misunderstanding hal,well dont worry about it
well dont worry about it,and dont you worry about it
and dont you worry about it,is your confidence in me fully restored
is your confidence in me fully restored,yes it is hal
yes it is hal,well thats a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
too bad about frank isnt it,yes it is
yes it is,i suppose youre pretty broken up about it
i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months,the antenna has to be replaced
the antenna has to be replaced,repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation,it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please
it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please,i dont really agree with you dave my onboard memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements
if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself theres no need for you to trouble,im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please
im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please,look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me
look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me,hal switch to manual hibernation control
hal switch to manual hibernation control,i dont like to assert myself dave but it would be much better now for you to rest youve been involved in a very stressful situation
i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest,hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control
hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control,im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it
im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it,hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you
i am prepared to do that anyway,i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission
i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission,listen to me very carefully hal unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection
continued,yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time
continued,did they have any explanation for this
continued,well what is it

well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius,really
really,yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days,you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days,thats right
thats right,i see
yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the ias convention,yes well i hope the crew got back safely
yes well i hope the crew got back safely,fortunately they did
fortunately they did,well im glad about that
dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question,certainly
certainly,quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius something apperently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts,dr smyslov im not permitted to discuss this
dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps,im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago,how can you tell it was deliberately buried
how can you tell it was deliberately buried,by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill,any clue as to what it is
any clue as to what it is,not really its completely inert no sound or energy sources have been detected the surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it a laser drill
but you dont have any idea as to what it is,tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice
any ideas about the colour,well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device
well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device,has it been exposed to any sun before now
has it been exposed to any sun before now,i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that

thank you,incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements,what do you mean
what do you mean,well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty
well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty,i see
i see,i take it this is something to do with the trouble theyre having up at clavius
well ill tell you why i ask you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her,i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm
i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm,yes well i wouldnt have been too concerned about it except ive heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact ive heard that ten people have died already

is there anything that can stop it,yesthank god
but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here,white turns to black light to dark life to death for all eternity

thats what the newspapers thought she spent the rest of her life in the asylum after kruegers trial she flipped out and hung herself so they thought,meaning

i should have suspectcd when i heard that doctor i thought it was your father,it was supposed to be dad had a heart attack two days ago
it was supposed to be dad had a heart attack two days ago,how is he
how is he,it was moderate hell be all right but it was out of the question his coming along
it was moderate hell be all right but it was out of the question his coming along,and they thought uyouu could re place the skipper
you could train someone else,not in two days look do you think i uwantedu to come if it didnt mean so much to dad proving his depthexplorer its the last thing id want
what is it,your out this came for you
your out this came for you,my father hes not
my father hes not,dead matter of fact hes much better hes left the hospital
what did you mean im out,your father can be in nome alaska tomorrow we have two choices ask them to send him out in a copter and take you off or the shark can put back into nome
you trade school boys are all alike arent you anybody who doesnt happen to think like a little goldbraided puppet is ipso facto a coward,uyouu said it but i wont argue
wearing a uniform doesnt bestow an automatic monopoly on courage ucommanderu it just so happens im unotu a coward physical or mental and before id risk my fathers life,were uallu risking our lives
were uallu risking our lives,that may be but dad stays where uheu is and im staying here
that may be but dad stays where uheu is and im staying here,youre really a mixedup oddball arent you
youre really a mixedup oddball arent you,perhaps but the idea of willingly going to uschoolu to spend my ulifeu at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunderlizards im referring to war uthatu strikes me as the uworstu cowardice of all being spiritually yellow
perhaps but the idea of willingly going to uschoolu to spend my ulifeu at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunderlizards im referring to war uthatu strikes me as the uworstu cowardice of all being spiritually yellow,you mean unothingu is worth fighting for
you mean unothingu is worth fighting for,peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit show me a man who says you win uthoseu by fighting wars and uillu show you an idiot
peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit show me a man who says you win uthoseu by fighting wars and uillu show you an idiot,you may not uwinu them but without men like your father to degrade himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them theyd have disappeared ulongu ago
unidentified flying objects,thenthis is a flying saucer
thats enough holloway ive told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine doesnt auto matically endow you with back bone,any more than being the son of captain neilsen does
however our ideas disagree as ive said before im unotu a coward and it happens youve got no choice either uiu take you down there in the lungfish or you dont get there,id sooner swim
theyre so remote cold beautiful the stars but now i wonder,yes
yes,which is the one we have to worry about
maybe just maybe when their ship doesnt return theyll decide not to come here after all,but if they udou
but if they udou,i dont know
i dont know,i wouldnt worry so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you the skipper dave kent sir ian and my father
i wouldnt worry so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you the skipper dave kent sir ian and my father,and his egghead son well give em a uroughu ureceptionu wont we
now dave old buddy you know youre exaggerating what do you think of this husband of yours on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer but unfortunately in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself,but julies a nice girl and ive seen you work she deserves a fighting chance
but julies a nice girl and ive seen you work she deserves a fighting chance,helen i appeal to you
reef,so they caught up with you too

at the worst possible moment tomorrow is janies birthday poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home now,uthatsu the worst possible moment
uthatsu the worst possible moment,what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl,disappointing a ubigu girl
youve asked why i stay a bachelor there goes the best reason i know,huh
huh,i might have a son like uthatu
i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy didnt he,i guess
i guess,one of the finest men and officers alive a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two he taught us engineering and design fought like a demon to develop atom subs
one of the finest men and officers alive a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two he taught us engineering and design fought like a demon to develop atom subs,so
so,so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist a real egghead dogooder and crackpot ban the atom tests junk the nuclear subs spend the mili tary budgetfor peace
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist a real egghead dogooder and crackpot ban the atom tests junk the nuclear subs spend the mili tary budgetfor peace,a lot of people think like that
but utheyreu not skipper neilsens son it broke his heart then when some newspapers called carl the honest sincere son of a warmongering father captain neilsen resigned from the navy oh he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the lungfish but it broke him all the same,have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side
have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side,his side ive seen it all right a nice bright yellow
cyclops,sounds like it distress call from a small freighter between ellesmere island and greenland one mayday thennothing
were stuck tight,skipper look at the depth gauge
youve got to let us try skipper,us
us,reef and i can take the explorer down clamp it around the eye and
you all wait here im going inside take a look,not ualoneu youre not
how about that the bow drove half through her but she sealed herself right up,whats more important theres our problem the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break if we can cut the ram the shark can pull herself loose
whats more important theres our problem the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break if we can cut the ram the shark can pull herself loose,i think youre right
i think youre right,go back and tell dr neilsen have him report to the skipper
yeah,listen hear that
i dont hear anything maybe youve been down here too long why dont you go back up and,strange you didnt hear it omit f
hey you know somethin its getting lighter in here,you know it uisu

dave,whats goin on in here lad what
get ready we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard,right skipper
is there any way out of it,seems to be all around
seems to be all around,what about down
what about down,idont know
course and speed,speedabout twentytwo knots coursedue north
a mass of jellylike stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo,what
what course skipper,right at our oneeyed friend
you better take powell and carney with you,the frogmen
the frogmen,with their underwater experience theyll be invaluable take sidearms and flare pistols
with their underwater experience theyll be invaluable take sidearms and flare pistols,sidearms but the saucers dead
sidearms but the saucers dead,we hope
excuse me skipper,yes griff
yes griff,all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor
skipper could you take a look here,something wrong
something wrong,the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash,why do you say that
why do you say that,were dead in the water but it indicates were moving
were dead in the water but it indicates were moving,what
we read you go ahead doctor theyre inside the saucer its filled with breathable air,wonderful
wonderful,thats wonderful carl reef thinks they can clear the shark bow so we can pull ourself loose
now they feel itdown below,radiation levelconstantly rising
excuse me captain there may be one last desperate chance a oneinathousand shot,anything
anything,its possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the pole
its possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the pole,what about time
it doesnt seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center,under uwateru
under uwateru,highintensity arcs will burn submerged and millions of voltsdischarged in random directions
above murmansk and finland,suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point
suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point,what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit perhaps be lying there waiting
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear but suppose it isnt at all what if its umagneticu,uweu harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force maybe cyclops does it on a usuperu scale
uweu harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force maybe cyclops does it on a usuperu scale,the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the earth itself
in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it recharging his batteries,if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
the radiation level from the saucer its rising,what direction does the system indicate
as we near the pole,theres got to be an explanation
theres got to be an explanation,there is i believe our friendcyclops is returning to life
all ready,as ready as we ucanu be ill report to the skipper
thought you were going to washington skipper,i did go just back reef these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt and dr clifford kent my exec commander richard holloway
i did go just back reef these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt and dr clifford kent my exec commander richard holloway,i met dr kent once

who with,dr neilsen hell be
doctor neilsen when did uthatu happen,huh
huh,itll be all right were old friends
what do you think,i think i should have joined the air force
determine extent of damage immediately,after torpedo room report
youre sure its cyclops,take a look
whats the running time,thirtyfour seconds
right uatu him,thats what i said
thats what i said,but what can we accomplish
but what can we accomplish,we can uramu him
a hundred and eighty fathoms we cant be sinking that fast,its the screws skipper at our declination angle running in reverse theyre pulling the shark uandu cyclops right to the bottom
its the screws skipper at our declination angle running in reverse theyre pulling the shark uandu cyclops right to the bottom,and were at safe maximum depth already stop engines
suppose theres an atmosphere of some kind inside cyclops,what
what,if we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the shark loose
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots,nothing we can do now
whats the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole,minus three
remove your weapons commander and come here alone,come where

thats why no water leaked inside when we rammed you,of course but it is time to be gin the return voyage
to navigate wont you have to see your way,obviously
obviously,uthatu might be a ulittleu uroughu
my yeoman will show you to your quarters,thank you
see what,the pattern each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle
well ill be,ill be another
just musing about our oneeyed adversary and the legend of homer cyclopes were the sons of heaven who forged the thunder bolts thrown by zeus,our cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself
you plotted the course of cyclops then thats uouru course wherever uheu goes uweu gountil we get him,or perhaps until he gets us
weve asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times,but uanswersu are what we need not more questions
due north at five knotsno six,toward the pole
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks,all right go to it

what do you mean sire,well i mean occasionally it seems to have how shall one say how shall one say director
i dont understand there are just as many notes majesty as are required neither more nor less,my dear fellow there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening i think im right in saying that arent i court composer
my dear young man dont take it too hard your work is ingenious its quality work and there are simply too many notes thats all cut a few and it will be perfect,which few did you have in mind majesty

may i introduce my father he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg he would so much like to kiss your hand it would make his whole stay so memorable for him,ah by all means
mozart are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre,yes sire
yes sire,yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true
yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true,who told you this majesty
who told you this majesty,it is not your place to ask questions is it true
it is not your place to ask questions is it true,well yes i admit it is
well yes i admit it is,would you tell me why
would you tell me why,well majesty it is only a comedy
mozart i am a tolerant man i do not censor things lightly when i do i have good reason figaro is a bad play it stirs up hatred between the classes in france it has caused nothing but bitterness my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people i do not wish to see the same fears starting here,sire i swear to your majesty theres nothing like that in the story i have taken out everything that could give offense i hate politics
sire i swear to your majesty theres nothing like that in the story i have taken out everything that could give offense i hate politics,i think you are rather innocent my friend in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece
but majesty this is just a frolic its a piece about love,ah love again
ah love again,but its new its entirely new its so new people will go mad for it for example i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling suddenly the wifes scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation duet turns into trio then the husbands equally screaming valet comes in trio turns into quartet then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet and so on on and on sextet septet octet how long do you think i can sustain that
but its new its entirely new its so new people will go mad for it for example i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling suddenly the wifes scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation duet turns into trio then the husbands equally screaming valet comes in trio turns into quartet then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet and so on on and on sextet septet octet how long do you think i can sustain that,i have no idea

forgive me majesty im a vulgar man but i assure you my music is not,you are passionate mozart but you do not persuade
you are passionate mozart but you do not persuade,sire the whole opera is finished do you know how much work went into it
ahha well then we should make some effort to acquire him we could use a good german composer in vienna surely,i agree majesty but im afraid its not possible the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop
i agree majesty but im afraid its not possible the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop,very small pay i imagine im sure he could be tempted with the right offer say an opera in german for our national theatre
